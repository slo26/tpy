### Better Exposed Filters Select

This module provides an additional exposed filter that fetches all available
field values for a string type field and provides a select element instad of
textfield input.

Additionally, it provides a new operator for the string filter:
"in (comma-separated)", when this is used with the new BEF filter
type, the select becomes a multi select.
